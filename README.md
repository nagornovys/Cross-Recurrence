# Cross-Recurrence
Example for cross-recurrence calculations for meta-sampling based on the MaxWiK algorithm.

R Script for the paper 'Recurrence Plots and 
Straightforward Hilbert Representation of Isolation Kernel'

R Script allows to calculate cross-recurrence plots and 
cross-recurrence quantification analysis (CRQA) for 2D example.

There are files and folders:

- Input data is in the Input.data folder,

- METHODS is a folder with the MaxWiK algorithm implementation,

- RESULTS is a folder with the results of the calculations,

- HYPERPARAMETERS is a folder with the hyperparameters of the algorithm,

- Metadaata.yml is a file with the metadata of the simulation,

- RUN.Metadata.R is a script to run a method using mtadata,

- crqa_2D_example.R is a script to calculate cross-recurrence plots and CRQA for 2D example,

- recurrence_plot.pdf is a pdf file with the plots for the 2D example.
